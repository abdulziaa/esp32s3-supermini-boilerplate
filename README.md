# ESP32S3 Supermini Boilerplate

I am annoyed of having to create new projects from scratch for this MCU every time I want to play around with a new component, sensor, or other xyz feature.

This repo has an esp-idf project that just... works.

Included is a LED and buzzer library that is used to validate that the device is functioning.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
